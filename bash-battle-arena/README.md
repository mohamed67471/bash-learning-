# Bash Battle Arena ðŸŽ®

The "Bash Battle Arena" is a command-line game I've designed to teach and improve Bash scripting skills in a fun and interactive way. The game presents players with a series of increasingly complex challenges that they must solve by writing Bash scripts. Each challenge is structured like a level in a game, and as players progress, they learn new Bash concepts and best practices.

## Objective

Players must complete various tasks or "missions" using Bash scripts. These tasks range from simple file manipulations to more complex system operations. The goal is to "defeat" each level by correctly solving the problem, with the ultimate aim of becoming a "Bash Master."
